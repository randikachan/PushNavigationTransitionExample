# PushNavigationTransitionExample
This is to explain some theory and practical usage of doing Push Navigation transition in native iOS Apps.
I came up with this sample project while I was writing an answer for one of the [StackOverflow question][1].

And I believe that any coding solution is always open to more improvements and same goes for this project too.
If you found some improvement or a better way which I could have achieved this, please let me know and improve my knowledge also.

**Note:** Don't forget to download this project, examin the files such as AppDelegate.swift and other ViewController swift classes and the storyboard to get a clear understanding.
